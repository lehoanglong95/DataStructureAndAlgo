What is Recursion?
+ There are two main instances of recursion.
+ The first is when recursion is used as a technique in which a function makes one or more calls to itself.
+ The second is when a data structure uses smaller instances of the exact same type of data structure when it represents itself.
Why use Recursion?
+ Recursion provides a powerful alternative for performing repetitions of tasks in which a loop is not ideal.
+ Most modern programming languages support recursion.
+ Recursion serves as a great tool for building out particular data structures.
