Doubly Linked List
+ In a doubly linked list, we define a linked list in which each node keeps an explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it.
+ These lists allow a greater variety of O(1) update operations, including insertions and deletions.
+ We continue to use the term "next" for the reference to the node that follows another.
+ We have a new term "prev" for the reference to the node that precedes it.
