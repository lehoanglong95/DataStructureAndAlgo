Tree Traversal:
- Preorder:
    + In a preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a recursive preorder traversal of the right subtree.
- Inorder:
    + In an inorder traversal, we recursively do an inorder traversal on the left subtree, visit the root node, and finally do a recursive inorder traversal of the right subtree.
- Postorder:
    + In a postorder traversal, we recurisvely do a postorder traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree followed by a visit to the root node.
