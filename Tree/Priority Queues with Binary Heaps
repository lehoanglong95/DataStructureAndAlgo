- One important variation of a queue is called a priority queue.
- A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing it from the front.
- However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority.
- The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back.
- When you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front.
- The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a dats stucture called a binary heap.
- A binary heap will allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in O(logn).
- The binary heap has two common variations: the min heap, in which the smallest key is alwayss at the front, and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front.
- In this section we will implement the min heap.
