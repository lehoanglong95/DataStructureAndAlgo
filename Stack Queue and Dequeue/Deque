+ A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar to queue.
+ It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items remain positioned in the collection.
+ What makes a dequeue different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items.
+ New items can be added at either the front or the rear.
+ Likewise, existing items can be removed from either end.
+ In a sense, this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure.
